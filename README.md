# üöÄ Coding Challenge: To-Do Application

Welcome to our coding challenge! We‚Äôre excited to see your skills in action. This challenge focuses on your ability to create a clean, reusable, and responsive application with an emphasis on readability, object-oriented design, and mobile-first development. Below are the instructions and requirements for building a To-Do application using Next.js and TailwindCSS.

## üìå Project Overview

Build a **To-Do Application** that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. You will be provided with a Next.js and TailwindCSS skeleton to get started. Your task is to implement the required features, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase. Focus on creating readable and reusable components, following object-oriented principles, and ensuring the application is mobile-first and responsive across all devices.

## üéØ Objectives

- Demonstrate proficiency in TypeScript, React/Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
- Showcase problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
- Implement responsive and accessible UI components.
- Write modular, reusable, and object-oriented code.
- Ensure the application is mobile-first and looks good on all devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features to Implement

### 1. **Task Management**

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new to-do items with a title and description.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.

### 2. **Accordion Component**

- **View Description:** Implement an accordion that opens on clicking a task to reveal its description.
- **Expand/Collapse:** Each task's description can be shown or hidden by toggling the accordion.
- **Reusability:** The accordion component should be reusable for different sections if needed.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the accordion follows accessibility best practices, including keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.

### 3. **State Management and Persistent Storage**

- **State Management:** Choose a state management solution such as React Context API, Zustand, or any other suitable library to manage the global state of the application.
- **Persistent Storage:** Utilize the browser's local storage to save and retrieve tasks, ensuring data persists across page reloads.
- **Integration:** Ensure that the state management seamlessly integrates with local storage for data persistence.

### 4. **UI Enhancements**

- **Task Forms:** Implement user-friendly forms for adding and editing tasks. Each form should include the following fields:

  - **Title:** Required field. Users must provide a title for each task.
  - **Description:** Optional field. Users can add additional details about the task.

  **Form Validation:**

  - Ensure that the **Title** field is not empty. If a user attempts to submit a form without a title, display a clear validation error message.
  - Provide real-time validation feedback as users fill out the form fields.
  - Disable the submit button until the required fields are properly filled out.

- **Animations:** Add subtle animations for interactions like adding or deleting tasks to enhance the UI.
- **Responsive Design:** TailwindCSS is mobile-first. Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on all devices. Use browser development tools to test and verify the design across different screen sizes.

## üîß Technical Requirements

- **Framework:** Next.js (latest version)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **State Management:** Choose a suitable solution (e.g., React Context API, Zustand)
- **UI Libraries:** You may use external UI libraries compatible with TailwindCSS to expedite styling.
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Ensure components are modular and reusable.
- **Version Control:** Use Git with meaningful commit messages.

## üì§ Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository:**

   - Fork the provided repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Implement the Features:**

   - Develop the application by implementing the required features.

3. **Commit Your Code:**

   - Make regular commits with clear and descriptive messages.

4. **Push to GitHub:**

   - Ensure all your changes are pushed to your forked repository.

5. **Provide Access:**

   - Share the link to your GitHub repository with us.

6. **Optional:** Include a live demo link if deployed (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
