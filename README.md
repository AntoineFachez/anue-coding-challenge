# 🚀 Coding Challenge: To-Do Application

Welcome to our coding challenge! We’re excited to see your skills in action. Below are the instructions and requirements for building a To-Do application using Next.js and TailwindCSS.

## 📌 Project Overview

Build a **To-Do Application** that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. You will be provided with a Next.js and TailwindCSS skeleton to get started. Your task is to implement the required features, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate proficiency in TypeScript, React/Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
- Showcase problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
- Implement responsive and accessible UI components.
- Write modular, reusable, and object-oriented code.

## 🛠️ Features to Implement

### 1. **Task Management**

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new to-do items with a title and description.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.

### 2. **Accordion Component**

- **View Description:** Implement an accordion that opens on clicking a task to reveal its description.
- **Expand/Collapse:** Each task's description can be shown or hidden by toggling the accordion.
- **Reusability:** The accordion component should be reusable for different sections if needed.

### 3. **State Management and Persistent Storage**

- **State Management:** Use React Context API to manage the global state of the application.
- **Persistent Storage:** Utilize the browser's local storage to save and retrieve tasks, ensuring data persists across page reloads.
- **Integration:** Ensure that the state management seamlessly integrates with local storage for data persistence.

### 4. **UI Enhancements**

- **Modal Windows:** Implement modal dialogs for adding and editing tasks to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Animations:** Add subtle animations for interactions like adding or deleting tasks to enhance the UI.
- **Responsive Design:** TailwindCSS is mobile-first. Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on all devices. Use browser development tools to test and verify the design across different screen sizes.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- **Framework:** Next.js (latest version)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **UI Libraries:** You may use external UI libraries compatible with TailwindCSS to expedite styling.
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Ensure components are modular and reusable.
- **Version Control:** Use Git with meaningful commit messages.

## 📤 Submission Guidelines

1. **Create a repository:**

   - Fork the provided repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Implement the Features:**

   - Develop the application by implementing the required features.

3. **Commit Your Code:**

   - Make regular commits with clear and descriptive messages.

4. **Push to GitHub:**

   - Ensure all your changes are pushed to your forked repository.

5. **Provide Access:**
   - Share the link to your GitHub repository with us.
